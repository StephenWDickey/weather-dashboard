## Description
In this week's challenge we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard.

This weather dashboard shows the date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and uv index when a city is entered into the search box. 

The UV index will feature color-coded styling based on if it has a favorable, moderate, or severe value.

In addition, a 5-day forecast for the city is generated as well listing the date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

This weather dashboard features localStorage use, which allows one to review a recent city search.

When a recent search is clicked, the weather data for that city will be fetched and displayed on the page.
